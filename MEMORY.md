# MEMORY.md — Project Decision Log

Durable project rules, current architecture decisions, and recurring gotchas for
smemu6. Keep this short. Prefer the deeper technical docs under `docs/dev/`
for hardware details, reverse-engineering traces, and one-off investigations.

## Project Rules

- Update the relevant documentation before committing code changes.
- Commit after every source-code modification using `type: description`.
- Use the repo-local `tmp/` directory for logs, scratch files, and test output.
- Reuse already-extracted floppy contents when they exist instead of
  re-extracting the same `.dsk` again.
- Releases are automated from pushed tags. Do not propose manual GitHub release
  creation for this repo.

## Build And Runtime Baselines

- Native build baseline: `cmake --build build --target smemu6`.
- Web build baseline on this Linux machine: use a repo-local
  `.emscripten-local` plus `.emscripten-cache`, then run web configure/build
  with `EM_CONFIG="$PWD/.emscripten-local"`.
- Local web smoke-test baseline: `tools/serve_web.sh` serves `build-web/` with
  the required COOP/COEP headers.
- For screen-output capture, use `-scrdump` together with `-no-display-off`.
  Either flag alone is not sufficient for the usual boot-to-prompt capture.
- `-no-launcher` is the fast path for emulator testing when the launcher UI is
  not under test.
- `-inject-str` fires when `machine_cli_prompt_visible()` reports that the CLI
  prompt is ready.
- DX0 boots automatically. Do not look for or reintroduce `-autoboot`.
- Use `-no-beeper` for routine automated runs.

## Current Architecture Decisions

### Web function keys use dedicated on-screen controls

Keep the native `F1`..`F7` mapping unchanged, but expose dedicated web controls
for CURSOR / COPY / KILL / PROGRA / SHOW / SEARCH / CHANGE.

Why:

- browsers and embedded webviews often reserve or swallow `F1`..`F7`
- the web UI needs reliable access to Smaky function keys after startup
- native semantics are preserved: left-press holds, release clears,
  right-click toggles a latch

### Clear host-owned ordinary key state on focus loss

When the SDL window loses focus, clear ordinary host-owned key state in the
keyboard layer rather than only resetting function bits.

Why:

- missing host key-up events during focus changes can otherwise leave ordinary
  keys latched and repeating indefinitely
- this matters especially in browsers, where focus transitions are frequent

### Mouse-latched function keys stay outside one-shot keyboard consumption

Keyboard-held function bits may be consumed one-shot for chord handling, but
mouse-latched status-bar or web-panel function bits remain persistent until the
user unlatches them.

Why:

- right-click function-key latches are a user-controlled UI state, not a
  transient keyboard scan event
- applying one-shot consumption to mouse latches breaks the intended hold/toggle
  behavior

### The web build excludes archived ST export helper tools

Keep the archived `SM6.ST` / `FLO.ST` exporter utilities and generated-header
targets out of the Emscripten build graph.

Why:

- they are host-side archival/developer tools, not browser runtime dependencies
- trying to build and execute them under Emscripten breaks the web build for no
  runtime benefit

### Bootable hostdir media requires metadata sidecars

When building a bootable DX0 hostdir from a floppy image, use
`tools/extract_samos_image.py` so file metadata sidecars are preserved.

Why:

- plain extracted files are not enough for SAMOS boot media
- load address, entry point, flags, dates, and sector ordering matter

## Known Limitations

### SDCC programs still do not return cleanly to the CLI

Current status:

- SDCC-compiled programs can run correctly but may corrupt the lower screen and
  fail to restore the CLI prompt on exit
- this is still a known limitation, not a resolved issue

Working baseline:

- use the CALM example `calm/examples/hello_smug/hello.sr` as the clean return
  baseline when comparing behavior

Implication:

- do not treat successful program output alone as proof that SDCC integration is
  correct; clean return-to-CLI behavior is part of the acceptance check

## Useful Pointers

- Hardware and reverse-engineering details belong in `docs/dev/`.
- Web-build usage and browser-specific behavior belong in `web/README.md`.
- Repeated failed approaches and recovery notes belong in `ERRORS.md`, not
  here.
